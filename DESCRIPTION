Description: Computes rainfall characteristics of independent rainfall events extracted from a sub-daily rainfall 
  time series based on the inter-event time definition (IETD) method. To have a reference value of IETD, it also 
  analyzes/computes IETD values through three methods: autocorrelation analysis, the average annual number of events 
  analysis, and coefficient of variation analysis. Ideal for analyzing the sensitivity of IETD to rainfall characteristics
  of independent rainfall events.
