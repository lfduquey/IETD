abstract = {An easily-applied approximate criterion is proposed for the separation of pointprecipitation records into statistically-independent storms. The criterion is tested successfully in parameter estimation for Poisson models of annual rainfall frequency in an arid climate. Analysis of rainfall records from a wide range of climates produces an empirical relation for estimating the minimum time between independent rainstorms, given only the mean annual rainfall and the mean length of the rainy season. {\textcopyright} 1982.},

abstract = {Traditional inter-event time definition (IETD) estimate methodologies generally take into account only rainfall characteristics and not drainage basin characteristics. Therefore, they may not succeed in providing an appropriate value of IETD for any sort of application to the design of urban drainage system devices. To overcome this limitation, this study presents a method of IETD determination that considers basin characteristics. The suggested definition of IETD is the time period from the end of a rainfall event to the end of a direct runoff. The suggested method can identify the independent events that are suitable for the statistical analysis of the recorded rainfall. Using the suggested IETD, the IETD of the Joong-Rang drainage system was determined and the area-IETD relation curve was drawn. The resulting regression curve can be used to determinate the IETD of ungauged urban drainage systems, with areas ranging between 40 and 4400 ha. Using the regression curve, the IETDs and time distribution of the design rainfall for four drainage systems in Korea were determined and rainfall-runoffsimulations were performed with the Storm Water Management Model (SWMM). The results were compared with those fromHuff's method which assumed a six-hour IETD. The peak flow rates obtained by the suggested method were 11{\%}{\~{}}15{\%} greater than those obtained by Huff's method. The suggested IETD determination method can identify independent events that are suitable for the statistical analysis of the recorded rainfall aimed at the design of urban drainage system devices. {\textcopyright} 2013 by the authors.},

abstract = {In the engineering practice routing reservoir sizing is commonly performed by using the design storm method, although its effectiveness has been debated for a long time. Conversely, continuous simulations and direct statistical analyses of recorded hydrographs are considered more reliable and comprehensive, but are indeed complex or seldom practicable. In this paper a handier tool is provided by the analytical-probabilistic approach to construct probability functions of peak discharges issuing from natural watersheds or routed through on-line and off-line reservoirs. A simplified routing scheme and a rainfall-runoff model based on a few essential hydrological parameters were implemented. To validate the proposed design methodology, on-line and off-line routing reservoirs were firstly sized by means of a conventional design storm method for a test watershed located in northern Italy. Their routing efficiencies were then estimated by both analytical-probabilistic models and benchmarking continuous simulations. Bearing in mind practical design purposes, adopted models evidenced a satisfactory consistency. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},
